Welcome to my new blog. For those that don't know me, my name is Andy Pike and I'm the Technical Director of a web development agency in the UK called 1minus1. This blog will contain posts on various subjects including programming, managing teams, ESports & gaming, raising kids and probably some other random stuff too.

## Goals

As it's the start of a new year I wanted to set myself some goals for the next twelve months. Last year I set myself the goal of getting down to a healthy weight and reasonable fitness. It was hard work but I made it in the end. So this year, here are some new personal goals to aim for:

1. Start up a blog and post to it regularly.
2. Speak at a Ruby conference (for the first time).
3. Improve my Ruby and general programming skills.
4. Attend an ESprorts event (again).
5. Maintain my current weight and fitness.
6. Author an e-book about my weight loss journey last year.

## Starting a Blog

Welp, as you can see I've started the blog :o) The hard bit is going to be posting regularly. I'm going to start off aiming for one post a week and see how that goes.

The blog is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). I'm using the [HPSTR Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme) at the moment without too many modifications but I might tweak it over time.

To start with I'm not going to enable comments on posts because, well, [here are a few reasons](http://mattgemmell.com/comments-off/). To contact me, the best place to start is Twitter [@andypike](http://twitter.com/andypike). Failing that, drop me an email to ```andy [at] andypike [dot] com```.

## Conference Speaking

This is going to be a big one for me. I've spoken at a couple of local user groups before but never at a large conference. If the up-scale isn't intimidating enough I still feel like a relative newcomer to the Ruby world (3-4 years) so what an earth can I speak about that will give value to an experienced audience. I've always felt that the best talks are the ones where I come away with either some new knowledge or even a spark of an idea that I can explore further. The trick here is finding a subject that I feel confident enough in but can also give the audience something to think about.

I have submitted proposals to [Ancient City Ruby 2014](http://www.ancientcityruby.com/), [EuRuKo 2014](http://www.euruko2014.org/) and [Scottish Ruby Conf 2014](http://2014.scottishrubyconference.com/). I'm waiting to hear from these conferences but if I'm unsuccessful then I'll try some others :o)

## Ruby and Programming

I've been doing Ruby (and Rails) for about 3-4 years now and I'm pretty confident with it all now. I came from a Microsoft .NET background before I made the switch. I think I'm at the point where I can make most things work with a reasonable solution but a lot of the time I look at my code and I just know there is a better "Ruby" way. The code isn't always beautiful but with a bit of research I can sometimes improve it.

I'm trying to read more this year. I tend to buy a lot of tech books but then don't end up reading them. I'll try to fix that this year too. I have just finished [Sandi Metz's POODR book](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330) which is really good and has certainly helped me. I've now made a start on the [GOOS book](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/) which will hopefully help improve my TDD.

The other thing I'll try to do is to contribute more to some open source projects and work with some people outside of my normal team. That way I'm hoping to be exposed to new techniques and ways of thinking. As part of this, I've made a start on the [Long Running Ruby Benchmarks](http://samsaffron.com/archive/2013/12/11/call-to-action-long-running-ruby-benchmark) project with Sam Saffron. It's very early days but we have something [up and running on Heroku](http://ruby-bench-staging.herokuapp.com/) already and the [code is of course on GitHub](https://github.com/ruby-bench/ruby-bench).

## ESports

If you follow me on Twitter then you will know that I have a passion for ESports. For those that don't know, it's watching geeks play computer games competitively for prize money. In particular, I watch a lot of StarCraft II both on YouTube and Twitch. In 2012, myself and my good buddy [@george_good](http://twitter.com/george_good) travelled to Sweden to watch the European SCII Finals. We had a great time, here are some of the highlights:

This year we're talking about going to Sweden again to attend [DreamHack](http://www.dreamhack.se/) which should be epic!

## Weight & Fitness

Last year I decided to lose some weight and get into shape. I dropped from over 17 stone (108.7KG) down to 12.5 stone (79.4KG). That means I lost 27% of my body weight, yikes! My aim this year is to keep my weight at around 80KG without straying too far above or below it. That should be easier than last year but still a challenge.

Last year I started running and managed to clock up 380KM since I started in April. This year I'll be starting up again in January after the Christmas break and hoping to break the 500KM mark over the twelve months which should be easily doable.

## Weight Loss E-Book

Becoming an author, that is definitely going to be a challenge, mainly because of time. I've written a ton of notes during the course of last year which cover a whole bunch of things regarding how I lost the weight and my mindset at the time. I think I have enough material to put something together that would help people in a similar situation. Anyway, we'll see how that goes. I'll post updates here when I have them so watch this space. Hopefully, by telling you all this it might help motivate me to crack on with it.

## New Avatar

Obviously the biggest thing is my new avatar. I've had the same avatar on all my online accounts for the past three years or so. Now is the time for an upgrade. I got some new glasses for Christmas and as you can see, my new avatar is radically different.

## That it for now

That wraps up my first post! I'm looking forward to the year ahead and the challenges that it brings. Let's do this...
